# sql_netflix_data-analysis

In this project, the data used is a table containing show type, title, producer, cast, country, duration and so on. Based on this table, the last movie was entered in the table in September 2021. Next, I performed an exploratory analysis on the data using SQL queries. The result of analysis also visualized on Tableau to create a dashboard.

The raw dataset was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows
